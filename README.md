Uni-Agent is a unified framework for general agents at scale.

- **All-in-one stack:** one framework for building, running, and training agents.
- **Unified agent interface:** unified abstractions for diverse and complex real-world agent scenarios.

The long-term vision is to build the backend infrastructure for next-generation agents across both inference and training, enabling them to perceive, act, and explore complex real-world tasks.

## Highlights ✨

**Unified yet decoupled agent stack:** Uni-Agent organizes agents around `model`, `tool`, and `env`, so each layer can be swapped independently while still composing into one unified interaction framework.

**Large-scale parallel interaction:** Uni-Agent supports high-throughput, stable parallel inference, execution, and verification for 1000+ concurrent agent tasks.

**One stack from inference to training:** Uni-Agent reuses the same interaction stack from large-scale agent execution to RL training, with support for advanced paradigms such as fully-async and partial rollout.

## Vision: Milo & Miko 🔮

Beyond the framework, the research direction we are building toward is **agents that continually learn from real conversations with the people who use them**. We are framing this around two flagship agents:

- **Project Milo** — the chat agent that actually gets you. Reads intent and subtext, learns what matters to you over time, and on top of that helps you get work done across schedules, mail, and docs. Seed prototype: [`app/lark_chat`](./app/lark_chat).
- **Project Miko** — the coding agent that actually gets the problem. Reads specs and codebases, reasons through real engineering challenges, and on top of that manages the whole project for excellent end-to-end performance.

This is a long-term proposal, not a current release. Read the full vision: [Agents That Grow With You](https://uni-agent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blog/vision.html).

## Quickstart 🚀

Start with the docs below:

- `Launch`: [Launch an agent environment](https://uni-agent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start/agent_env.html) to run simple demo scripts.
- `Build`: [Build a simple search agent](https://uni-agent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start/arxiv_search_agent.html) with minimal customization for arXiv paper search and recommendation.
- `Search`: [Train a search agent](https://uni-agent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start/search_agent.html) on ASearcher with a LocalWiki retrieval service.
- `Scale`: [Run parallel agent interaction](https://uni-agent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start/agent_interaction.html) for large-scale interaction, inference, and verification workloads.
- `Train`: [Train an agent with reinforcement learning](https://uni-agent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start/agent_train.html) using state-of-the-art training techniques.

## Architecture 🧩

<img src="./assets/uni-agent.png" width="80%" alt="Uni-Agent architecture overview">

Uni-Agent is built around a unified interaction loop with three parts: `model`, `tool`, and `env`.

- `model` is the reasoning backend that decides what to do next,
- `tool` is how the `model` perceives and acts on the `env`
- `env` is the runtime environment where actions are executed and state is preserved.

This interaction stack is used for large-scale agent execution and can be connected to [verl](https://github.com/verl-project/verl) for scalable RL training.

## Installation 📦

Uni-Agent builds on top of latest `verl` release and can use it as a normal Python package.

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
pip install --no-deps -e ./verl

# Other Dependencies
pip install swe-rex loguru pydantic pydantic_settings aiohttp
```

See the full installation guide in the docs: [Installation](https://uni-agent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start/installation.html).


## Live Dashboard 👀

<img src="./assets/dashboard.png" width="100%" alt="Uni-Agent Dashboard overview">

Uni-Agent includes a lightweight dashboard for monitoring large parallel runs in real time. It is designed for workloads such as parallel inference and reinforcement learning.

Start the dashboard from the repository root:

```bash
python -m dashboard.server --log-dir /tmp/swebench_qwen3_coder --port 8765
```

See [`dashboard/README.md`](./dashboard/README.md) for more details.


## Results 📊

### Parallel Inference & Verification

We compare Uni-Agent with existing agent systems on parallel inference and verification workloads.


| Model            | Benchmark          | OpenHands | Uni-Agent | Setting |
| ---------------- | ------------------ |:---------:|:---------:| ------- |
| Qwen3-Coder-30B  | SWE-Bench Verified | -         | **49.2**  | Avg@4, 100 turns, 128K |
| Qwen3-Coder-480B | SWE-Bench Verified | 62.4      | **64.2**  | Avg@4, 500 turns, 256K |

| Qwen3.6-35B-A3B  | Terminal-Bench v2  | -         | **42.5**  | Avg@1, 200K |


### Agent Reinforcement Learning

Uni-Agent supports agent RL training with the same interaction stack used at inference time. We provide fully async training recipes across multiple tasks, models and datasets, with GRPO/GSPO-style objectives and partial rollout support.
Example scripts are available in [examples/agent_train](examples/agent_train).


| Model                        | Dataset      | Method | Setting | Base | RL |
| ---------------------------- | ------------ | ------ | ------- |:----:|:--:|
| Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct       | R2E-Gym      | GSPO   | Fully Async, 100 turns, 128K | 22.2 | **36.8** |
| Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct | R2E-Gym      | GSPO   | Fully Async, 100 turns, 128K | 46.2 | **52.0** |
| Qwen3.5-9B                   | SWE-reBench  | GRPO   | Fully Async, 100 turns, 128K | 53.8 | **59.2** |

More training dynamics, including reward, validation score, and average-turn curves, are available in the [agent training guide](https://uni-agent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start/agent_train.html).
