"""Generate a small mock dataset satisfying verl's RLHFDataset format.

The multi_agent_blackbox example trains with ``return_raw_chat: true``, so the
``prompt`` column must be an OpenAI-style chat message list. verl's
NaiveRewardManager reads ``reward_model["ground_truth"]``, so each row carries a
``reward_model`` dict with a ``ground_truth`` list (verl standard data format).

Output:
    examples/multi_agent_blackbox/scripts/mock_data/mock_mas_train.parquet
    examples/multi_agent_blackbox/scripts/mock_data/mock_mas_val.parquet

Usage:
    python examples/multi_agent_blackbox/scripts/generate_mock_mas_data.py
