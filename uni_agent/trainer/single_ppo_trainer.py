"""Minimal single-policy v1 PPO trainer for multi-agent orchestration.

``MultiAgentsPPOTrainer`` owns one shared dataloader + one shared replay
buffer at the outer level, so per-policy trainers do not need to build their
own. This subclass keeps every verl sync-trainer capability (resource-pool /
worker / vLLM init, tokenizer, phase methods, checkpoint manager) and only
skips the two outer-owned pieces:

- ``_build_replay_buffer``: the outer trainer builds the shared ReplayBuffer.
- ``_init_dataloader``: the outer trainer loads the dataset once, not once per
  policy (avoids N full dataset loads for N policies).

The tokenizer is intentionally kept: ``_balance_batch`` (called by the outer
update path) reads ``self.tokenizer.eos_token_id``, and the outer dataloader
also needs the tokenizer/processor from the first policy trainer.

Mirror verl trainer_base (v1 sync trainer, commit 130aa20-era). Because this
class *removes* init steps (unlike verl's own subclasses, which mostly *add*),
any new mandatory init step added by verl in ``__init__``/``_setup`` must be
re-checked here on upgrade.
